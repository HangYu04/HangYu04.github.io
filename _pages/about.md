Hi,👋 I am Hang Yu, an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science at ShanghaiTech University. Currently, I am conducting research in the [4DVLab](https://4dvlab.github.io/) led by [Professor Yuexin Ma](https://yuexinma.me/). My research interests include Computer Vision, Embodied Intelligence, and AIGC (AI-Generated Content). I am eager to learn from others and always open to collaborations!
